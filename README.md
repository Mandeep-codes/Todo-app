# ✅ React Todo App

A clean and functional Todo List app built using **React**. This project helps users manage their daily tasks with features like adding, deleting, and toggling completion of todos — all handled with React's component-level state, no Redux involved.

🛠️ I built this while learning the fundamentals of React like `useState`, props, component structure, and conditional rendering. It was a great practice project for understanding how React apps manage dynamic user interfaces.
